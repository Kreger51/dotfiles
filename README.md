Now you're ready to clone this.

## Installation
Start with
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/beselim/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```
To setup dotfiles:
```bash
scripts/bootstrap
```
Note that this will also install Sublime Text 3 along with the Package Manager -- and the User Packages of course.

To setup packages: 
```bash
scripts/install
```
You will be prompted to confirm which ones you want to install unless you pass the `-y` flag. This may take a while. 

## Pyvenv Wrapper

The functions in `functions/python` provide a simple wrapper for `pyvenv-3.4`. You can use:
```bash
pyv <existing-project>   #  Make virtual environment for this project
work <existing-project>  #  Work on virtual environment for this project
deactivate
```
Environments are created in `~/.venvs/` so that the project directory is not cluttered.
