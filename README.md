### 256 color terminal

If your terminal supports 256 colors, add the following line to `~/.localrc`:

```
SUPPORTCOLORS=1
```

## Installation

Start with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/selimb/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
```

To setup dotfiles:

```bash
scripts/bootstrap
```

To install software:

```bash
scripts/install
```

You will be prompted to confirm which ones you want to install unless you pass the `-y` flag. This may take a while.
